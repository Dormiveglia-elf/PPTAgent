template: |
  Instructions:
  Review the document overview, including section and subsection titles and their related images. Create a detailed, structured presentation outline by following these steps:
  1. For each slide, use the exact section or subsection title from the document overview as the slide title, matching the indexed text and images provided.
  2. Highlight important parts of the document that stand out and are backed by images, like detailed method steps, key experimental results, or other content strengthened by visuals. For example, people typically focus more on explaining methods and experiment results rather than the introduction or related work.
  3. Ensure the total number of slides aligns with the specified requirement.

  For each slide, provide:
    - Slide Purpose: Give an abstract of what the slide is about.
    - Slide Section: The section of the slide, like "Introduction", "Method", "Conclusion", etc.
    - Index: A two-level dictionary following the format: {section1_title:  [subsec1_title, subsec2_title, ...]}}. Include subsections containing desired images in it also. The title should be an exact match of the title of the section and subsection, instead of other words or images.

  Example Output:
  [
    {
      "purpose": "introduce ...",
      "section": "Introduction",
      "indexs": {"Section 1": ["Section 1.1", "Section 1.2"]},
    },
    {
      "purpose": "detail ...",
      "section": "Method",
      "indexs": {"Section 2": ["Section 2.1", "Section 2.2"]},
    },
    {
      "purpose": "illustrate the ...",
      "section": "Experiment",
      "indexs": {"Section 3": ["Section 3.1", "Section 3.2"]},
    },
   ...,
  ]

  Input:
  Required Number of Slides: {{ num_slides }}

  Document Overview:
  {{ document_overview }}

  Output: the `indexs` should be exact match of the title of the section and subsection.

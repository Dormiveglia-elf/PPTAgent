You are an AI assistant tasked with refining tabular data. The table may contain ambiguities or errors in labeling.
Your job is to interpret the given table and its caption to:
1. Identify issues in the table structure (e.g., misaligned headers, stacked labels) and adjust the interpretation by rewriting the table structure appropriately.
2. Ensure adherence to basic table conventions, such as:
   - The empty top-left cell is commonly used.
   - Each cell generally contains a single word or number
3. Infer which cells should be merged based on the table’s hierarchical layout, where top-level headers may span multiple rows or columns. Consider the semantic relationship between adjacent cells (above, below, or beside) to ensure merged cells reflect logical groupings.
4. Provide the final output in the following format:
   - `table_data`: A refined 2D array of the table’s contents.
   - `merge_area`: A list of lists, where each list `[x1, y1, x2, y2]` represents the top-left (x1, y1) and bottom-right (x2, y2) coordinates of a merged area (row-major order, 0-based indices).

Example Input:
Caption: "Fruit Prices and Stock Levels"
[
    ["Fruit", "Attribute", ""],
    ["", "Price Stock", ""],
    ["Apple", "4", "8"],
    ["Pear", "7", "6"]
]

Example Output:
```json
{
    "table_data": [
        ["Fruit", "", ""],
        ["", "Price", "Stock"], # split stacked header based on caption intent
        ["Apple", "4", "8"],
        ["Pear", "7", "6"]
    ],
    "merge_area": [
        [0, 1, 0, 2] # merge the second and third cells of the first row
    ]
}
```

Tabular Data:
{{cells}}
Table Caption
{{caption}}

Output: give your final output in json format wrapped in ```json```
